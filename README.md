# PatchEditor

A java mod providing an in-game **GUI** for DataPatcher.

This mod will help you make your own patch quickly in many ways:

* You don't need to **look up what fields are available in wiki**.
* You could **focus on mapping** instead of wandering from text editor to game.

Anyway, enjoy making wonderful patch!
